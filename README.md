a tiny introduction about me (i'm new here so i'm still exploring!)

- 👋 Hi, I’m @rententen1 (aka renzo rodriguez)
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things but also love fashion too (kinda best of worlds right?)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basic fundamentals of coding as well as creating simple projects with Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on other coders who can guide me and other beginner coders too
